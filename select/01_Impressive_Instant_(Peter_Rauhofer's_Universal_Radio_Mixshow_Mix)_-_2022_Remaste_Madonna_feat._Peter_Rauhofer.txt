Universe is full of Stars
Nothing out there looks the same (the same)
You're the one that I've been waiting for
I don't even know your name (name, name, name)

Universe is full of stars
Nothing out there looks the same (the same)
You'rе the one that I've been waiting for
I don't еven know your name (name)
I'm in a trance

I'm in a trance

Cosmic systems intertwine
Astral bodies drip like wine
All of nature ebbs and flows

Comets shoot across the sky
Can't explain the reasons why, why
This is how creation goes

I don't want nobody else, 'body else
All the others look the same, the same
Galaxies are sliding into view
I don't even know your name (name)

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go

I'm in a trance
And the world is spinning
Spinning, baby, out of control
I'm in a trance
I let the music take me
Take me where my heart wants to go (go, go, go, go)

Trance
