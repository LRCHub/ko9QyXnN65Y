You say that you need my love
And you're wanting my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere

This physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction, yeah

Trying hard to get away
But I can't seem to fight the way I feel
Even though you're not for real
Your touch is driving me
Crazy and when you smile
It's just makin' me want you more and more
Baby won't you stay a while
It could be such a fantasy

Physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
Sweet satisfaction, yeah

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

This physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction, yeah

Attraction, reaction but so much satisfaction
Attraction, reaction but so much satisfaction
It's a physical, physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
Physical, physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
Physical, physical attraction
