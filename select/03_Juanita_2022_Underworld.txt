You rails
You're thin
Your thin paper wings
Your thin paper wings
In the wind
Dangling
Your sun
Fly high
Your windows shattering
Your rails
Your thin paper wings
Sugar box
Sugar boy
Riding in
Riding in
Sugar box
Sugar boy
Handheld candle
Sugar boy
You rails
You're thin
Your thin paper wings
Your thin paper wings
In the wind
Dangling
Fly high
Your windows shatter in the wind
Your coca cola sign
Rattling
Rattling
Resonator
Homeless trees
Gathering
Outside your windows bootleg babies call to you
And lie among the mosquitoes
That summers fever coming
Cats are gathering outside your window
Homeless trees
Bootleg babies calling to you
Lie among
Lie among the mosquitoes
Your rails
You're thin
Your thin paper wings
Paper wings
Resonator
There is sound on the other side of this wall
A bird is singing on the other side of this glass
Footsteps
Concealed
Silence is preserving a voice
Walking in the wind at the waters edge comes
Close to covering my rubber feet Listening to the barbed wire hanging
There is a sound on the other side of this wall
A bird is singing on the other side of this glass
Footsteps
Concealed
Silence is preserving a voice
Silver chain
Thrown away
Broken wing
